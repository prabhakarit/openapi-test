Here is an example Terraform code to deploy an AWS Lambda function behind an Amazon API Gateway:



This code creates an AWS Lambda function, an IAM role for the function, an Amazon API Gateway, and deploys the Lambda function behind the API Gateway. The Lambda function is triggered by a POST request to the `/example` resource on the API Gateway. The API Gateway deployment is created in the `prod` stage.
