Here is an example of a Serverless Framework YAML code for a Node.js AWS Lambda function with an Amazon API Gateway:



In this example, we define a service called "my-service" with the AWS provider. We specify that we want to use Node.js 14.x as the runtime and that our Lambda function should be deployed in the us-east-1 region.

We define a single function called "hello" with a handler function called "handler.hello". This function is triggered by an HTTP GET request to the "/hello" path on the API Gateway.

This YAML code can be used to deploy the Lambda function and API Gateway using the Serverless Framework.
