Here is an example of a serverless framework YAML code for a Node.js AWS Lambda function with Amazon API Gateway:



In this example, we define a service called "my-service" and specify that we are using AWS as the provider with Node.js 14.x as the runtime.

We then define a function called "hello" with a handler function called "handler.hello". This function is triggered by an HTTP GET request to the "/hello" path.

Finally, we include the "serverless-offline" plugin, which allows us to test our function locally before deploying it to AWS.
