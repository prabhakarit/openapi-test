Here is an example of a Serverless Framework YAML code for a Node.js AWS Lambda function with Amazon API Gateway:



In this example, we define a service called "my-service" with the AWS provider. We specify the runtime as Node.js 14.x and the region as us-east-1.

We define a function called "hello" with a handler function called "handler.hello". This function is triggered by an HTTP event with a path of "/hello" and a method of "get". This means that when a GET request is made to the "/hello" endpoint on the API Gateway, the "handler.hello" function will be executed.

You can customize this YAML code to fit your specific use case.
