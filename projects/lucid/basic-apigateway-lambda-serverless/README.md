Here is an example of a Serverless Framework YAML code for a Node.js AWS Lambda function with an Amazon API Gateway:



In this example, we define a service called "my-service" with the AWS provider. We specify the runtime as Node.js 14.x and the region as us-east-1.

We then define a function called "hello" with a handler of "handler.hello". This means that the function code will be in a file called "handler.js" and the exported function will be called "hello".

Finally, we define an event for the function which is an HTTP GET request to the "/hello" path on the API Gateway. This means that when the API Gateway receives a GET request to the "/hello" path, it will trigger the "hello" function.
