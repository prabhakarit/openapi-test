Here is an example Terraform code to deploy an AWS Lambda function with an Amazon RDS database:



This code creates a VPC, subnet, security groups for the Lambda function and RDS database, an RDS database instance, a Lambda function, and an IAM role for the Lambda function. The Lambda function is configured to run in the VPC and access the RDS database using environment variables. The IAM role is attached with the AmazonRDSFullAccess policy to allow the Lambda function to access the RDS database.
