Here is an example Terraform code to deploy an AWS Lambda function with Amazon S3 as a trigger:



In this example, we first define the AWS provider and the S3 bucket that will trigger the Lambda function. We then define the Lambda function itself, including its name, handler, runtime, role, and code file. We also define the IAM role and policy for the Lambda function, which grants it permission to access the S3 bucket. Finally, we define the S3 bucket notification configuration, which specifies that the Lambda function should be triggered when a new object is created in the bucket with a prefix of "uploads/".
