Please note that this is an experimental implementation. It can only provide a template as a suggestive start.
Following is documentation passed by ChatGPT : 
Here is an example of a Serverless Framework YAML code for a Node.js AWS Lambda function with an Application Load Balancer:



In this example, we define a service called "my-service" with the AWS provider and Node.js 14.x runtime. We also specify the region and a prefix for the target group that will be created for the Application Load Balancer.

We then define a function called "my-function" with a handler called "handler.myFunction". This function is triggered by an event from an Application Load Balancer listener with a specific ARN. The event is configured to trigger when the path "/my-path" is requested.

Note that you will need to have an existing Application Load Balancer and listener set up in your AWS account for this code to work.
