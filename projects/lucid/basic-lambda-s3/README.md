Following is documentation passed by ChatGPT : 
Here is an example Terraform code to deploy an AWS Lambda function with Amazon S3:



This code creates an AWS Lambda function named "example_lambda" that is triggered by an S3 bucket named "example-bucket". The Lambda function code is stored in a ZIP file named "example_lambda.zip". The Lambda function is associated with an IAM role named "lambda_role" that has the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket. The S3 bucket contains an object named "example_object.txt" that the Lambda function can access. 

Note that you will need to replace the region, bucket name, and other values with your own values. You will also need to create the "example_lambda.zip" file and the "example_object.txt" file and place them in the same directory as the Terraform code.
