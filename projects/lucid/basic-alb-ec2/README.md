Here is an example Terraform code to deploy an Amazon EC2 instance behind an Application Load Balancer:



This code creates an EC2 instance, a security group for the EC2 instance, an Application Load Balancer, a target group for the EC2 instance, and a listener for the Application Load Balancer. The EC2 instance is registered with the target group, and the target group is associated with the listener. This allows traffic to be routed to the EC2 instance through the Application Load Balancer.
