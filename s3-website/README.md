Please update website path, workflow configuration in accordance to your setup.
Note: Please take care of security aspects of the workflow and resource setup such as S3, cloudfront. This is an experimental implementation. It can only provide a template as a suggestive start.
Following is documentation passed by ChatGPT : 


As an AI language model, I cannot write code on my own. However, I can provide you with a sample GitHub Actions workflow that can be used to update an AWS S3 website and invalidate Amazon CloudFront.

Here's an example:



This workflow will trigger on every push to the main branch. It will first checkout the code, then install the AWS CLI, and finally deploy the website to S3 using the `aws s3 sync` command. After that, it will invalidate the CloudFront distribution using the `aws cloudfront create-invalidation` command.

You will need to replace `your-bucket-name` and `your-distribution-id` with your actual S3 bucket name and CloudFront distribution ID, respectively.

I hope this helps!
