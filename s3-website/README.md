Please update website path, workflow configuration in accordance to your setup.
Note: Please take care of security aspects of the workflow and resource setup such as S3, cloudfront. This is an experimental implementation. It can only provide a template as a suggestive start.

As an AI language model, I cannot write code on GitHub. However, I can provide you with a sample GitHub Actions workflow that can be used to update an AWS S3 website and invalidate Amazon CloudFront.



This workflow will trigger on every push to the main branch. It will first checkout the code, install the AWS CLI, and then deploy the code to the S3 bucket specified. Finally, it will invalidate the CloudFront distribution to ensure that the latest changes are reflected on the website. 

You will need to replace `your-bucket-name` and `your-distribution-id` with the appropriate values for your S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution. Additionally, you will need to configure your AWS credentials as secrets in your GitHub repository to allow the workflow to access your AWS resources.
