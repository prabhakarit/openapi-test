Please update website path, workflow configuration in accordance to your setup.
Note: Please take care of security aspects of the workflow and resource setup such as S3, cloudfront. This is an experimental implementation. It can only provide a template as a suggestive start.

As an AI language model, I cannot write code from scratch. However, I can provide you with a sample GitHub Actions workflow that you can use as a reference to update your AWS S3 website and invalidate Amazon CloudFront.

Here's an example:



This workflow will trigger on every push to the main branch. It will first checkout the code, install the AWS CLI, and then sync the files from the `dist` folder to your S3 bucket. Finally, it will invalidate the CloudFront distribution by creating a new invalidation with the `/*` path.

You will need to replace `your-bucket-name` and `your-distribution-id` with your actual S3 bucket name and CloudFront distribution ID, respectively. Also, make sure to set up your AWS access keys as secrets in your repository settings.

I hope this helps!
