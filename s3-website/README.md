Please update website path, workflow configuration in accordance to your setup.
Note: Please take care of security aspects of the workflow and resource setup such as S3, cloudfront. This is an experimental implementation. It can only provide a template as a suggestive start.
Following is documentation passed by ChatGPT : 


As an AI language model, I cannot write code on my own. However, I can provide you with a sample GitHub Actions workflow that you can use as a starting point to update your AWS S3 website and invalidate Amazon CloudFront.

Here's an example workflow:



This workflow will trigger on every push to the main branch. It will then run the following steps:

1. Checkout the code from the repository.
2. Install the AWS CLI and configure it with the access key and secret access key stored in GitHub Secrets.
3. Sync the files in the repository to the S3 bucket specified in the workflow.
4. Invalidate the CloudFront distribution specified in the workflow.

Make sure to replace `your-bucket-name` and `your-distribution-id` with the actual names of your S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution, respectively.

I hope this helps!
